# Feature-Based Architecture Migration Guide

## Overview

We've successfully migrated from a layered architecture to a feature-based architecture. This provides better organization, maintainability, and scalability for the AI Resume Builder project.

## New Directory Structure

## Completed Features

### âœ… Users Feature
- **Models**: User
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/v1/users/` - Create user
  - `GET /api/v1/users/{user_uuid}` - Get user by UUID
  - `GET /api/v1/users/` - List users
  - `PUT /api/v1/users/{user_uuid}` - Update user
  - `DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_uuid}` - Delete user

### âœ… Work Experiences Feature
- **Models**: WorkExperience
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/work-experiences/` - Create work experience
  - `GET /api/v1/work-experiences/{work_exp_uuid}` - Get work experience by UUID
  - `GET /api/v1/work-experiences/user/{user_uuid}` - Get user's work experiences
  - `PUT /api/v1/work-experiences/{work_exp_uuid}` - Update work experience
  - `DELETE /api/v1/work-experiences/{work_exp_uuid}` - Delete work experience

### âœ… Education Feature (Partial)
- **Models**: Education
- **Status**: Model created, needs schemas/service/router

### âœ… Skills Feature (Complete)
- **Models**: Skill
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/skills/` - Create skill
  - `GET /api/v1/skills/{skill_uuid}` - Get skill by UUID

### âœ… Certificates Feature (Partial)
- **Models**: Certificate

## Pending Features to Create

### ðŸš§ High Priority
1. **Certificates Feature** - Complete implementation (schemas/service/router)
2. **Education Feature** - Complete implementation (schemas/service/router)
3. **Languages Feature** - Language skills
4. **Resumes Feature** - Resume generation and management

### ðŸš§ Medium Priority
1. **Job Matching Feature** - Job description analysis and matching
2. **Profiles Feature** - Professional summaries and custom sections

### ðŸš§ Low Priority
1. **System Feature** - System events and vector embeddings

## Migration Benefits

### âœ… Achieved
- **Better Organization**: Related code is grouped together
- **Clearer Dependencies**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Easier Testing**: Features can be tested independently
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple developers can work on different features
- **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific features

### ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices Implemented
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent API structure
- Type hints with Pydantic schemas

## Running the Application

```bash
# From project root
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Application will be available at:
# - API: http://localhost:8000
# - Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
# - Health: http://localhost:8000/health
```

## API Structure

All feature endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/` and use UUIDs as identifiers:

- `/api/v1/users/*` - User management
- `/api/v1/work-experiences/*` - Work experience management  
- `/api/v1/projects/*` - Project portfolio management
- `/api/v1/skills/*` - Skills management
- `/api/v1/education/*` - Education records (to be implemented)
- `/api/v1/certificates/*` - Professional certifications (to be implemented)

**Note**: All API endpoints use UUIDs as public identifiers. The internal integer `id` is used only for database performance and relationships.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Partial Features**: Finish education and skills features
2. **Create Remaining Features**: Projects, certificates, languages, etc.
3. **Add Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
4. **Add Authorization**: Role-based access control
5. **Add Validation**: Enhanced data validation and business rules
6. **Add Tests**: Unit and integration tests for each feature
7. **Add Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation

## Development Workflow

When creating a new feature:

1. Create directory in `app/features/{feature_name}/`
2. Add models in `models.py`
3. Define schemas in `schemas.py`
4. Implement repository in `repository.py`
5. Add business logic in `service.py`
6. Create API routes in `router.py`
7. Export in `__init__.py`
8. Add to `features/__init__.py` router list
9. Update `shared/models/registry.py` if needed

This architecture will scale well as the AI Resume Builder grows in complexity!
